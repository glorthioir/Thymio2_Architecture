# Thymio2_Architecture
This project is a hierarchical control architecture for a Thymio 2 robot.

Here you can find a link to the robot: https://www.thymio.org/

This architecture is written in C and requires a special API to communicate with the robot as this later one uses its own programming language.
Installation steps are described in the "User_guide.pdf" file in addition to the diverse implemented functions.
